# SAV to CSV Converter

This small Python tool allows you to convert SPSS SAV files to CSV format using the `pyreadstat` library.

## Installation

Before using the SAV to CSV Converter, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyreadstat
```

## Usage

1. Download the `sav_to_csv_converter.py` script from this repository.

2. Place your SPSS SAV file (e.g., `input.sav`) in the same directory as the script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and your SAV file.

4. Run the following command:

```bash
python sav_to_csv_converter.py input.sav
```

This will convert the SAV file to CSV and save it as `input.csv` in the same directory.

## Example

Here's an example Python script (`sav_to_csv_converter.py`) that uses `pyreadstat` to convert an SAV file to CSV:

```python
import pyreadstat

def convert_sav_to_csv(input_file):
    try:
        df, meta = pyreadstat.read_sav(input_file)
        output_file = input_file.replace('.sav', '.csv')
        df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
        print(f"Conversion successful. CSV file saved as '{output_file}'")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python sav_to_csv_converter.py input.sav")
    else:
        input_file = sys.argv[1]
        convert_sav_to_csv(input_file)
```
